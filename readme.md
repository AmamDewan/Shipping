## About This Package

This is a Laravel package for my personal project. I'm shipping forwarder in China. This is my side business. People order products from [Taobao](https://taobao.com) or [1688.com](https://1666.com) through myself. Nowadays order are so huge and keep tracking of everything through exelsheet or hand note is hard for me. So I decided to create an application which will help me for this work

Features will be updated later
